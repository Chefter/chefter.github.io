January is a time of change, renewed energy and usually the beginning of some self-set resolutions. After New Years celebrations where we throw down with champagne and snacks following the holiday season where we enjoyed plenty of good meals, now we get to hit the **reset button**. 

The # 1 New Years resolution in America for the past 10 years and counting? **Lose weight and be healthier**. Hmm...that sounds familiar! 

The # 1 _broken_ New Years resolution in America for the past 10 years and counting? You guessed it! Now more than ever, Americans are struggling with **leading a healthier and happier lifestyle**. 

Losing weight and being healthier _starts in the kitchen_. Everyone knows the steps they need to take in order to lead a healthier lifestyle...eat healthier and make sure it's real food, incorporate physical activity into your daily routine, drink your recommended daily amount of water, etc. But it can also be difficult to make these lifestyle changes on your own. 

Smartphones are extremely helpful and integral to our daily lives. With all of the **amazing apps** out there, you can count calories and track meals, monitor your daily physical activity and the amount of water you've had to drink, keep you calendar organized, plan your outfits, and the list goes on.
