For the majority of people out there, cooking can be extremely daunting. Everyone is so worried about what ends up on the plate and how good it tastes, that they totally lose the fun of the experience in the process. Chefter was created to bring fun back into the kitchen with a little extra skill. We love getting feedback from home cooks who talk with our Chefs as often as we can. Recently we received an email from a home cook about their experience and it truly speaks to the experience of Chefter. 

A letter from _Cooking in Columbus (GA)_: 

“So instead of going to one of the same few local restaurants or to see another movie, my boyfriend and I decided try out an app my friend told me about called Chefter. She is an avid foodie and knows I'm into that kind of thing so we decided to "call a chef" and stay in for our date night. Neither of us are skilled cooks but we certainly love food. Off the bat, I had a little admitted anxiety about calling a stranger and showing them my basically average kitchen and not so miraculous equipment. After scrolling through all of the Chefs and Recipes, I just _had_ to call and see what all this was about.” 

“First off, I didn't have to face to face with a stranger (okay, I'm a bit socially awkward and in my PJs), which was a huge relief! All I had to do was show the chef my kitchen and what I was working with through my camera. So that took a lot of pressure off. Secondly, I love that we already knew each other based off of our profiles. I was prepared to go through the whole this is me, who are you, this is what I like to eat, blah blah blah. But we were already familiar with each other right off the bat! It was so much easier than any cooking class I've ever taken. I got Chef Nel, who I think is Jamaican, and most certainly very chill."

“Having Chef Nel right on my iPhone, guiding me through the experience, made cooking 100 times easier! With her help, I was able to eye ingredients, which I never thought I’d be able to do. And best of all, my boyfriend and I (and I’m pretty Chef Nel, too!) were all having good time, enjoying cooking together instead of me cooking the same few meals. There may have been a few glasses of wine involved. And the meal we made together with her was spectacular! I even got a few cooking tips and tricks that I’ll use every time I'm in the kitchen now.” 

“I was even able to take a pic of my own food for Instagram!! One of my proudest accomplishments. I could even tag the chef that helped me cook it and, of course, Chefter. It definitely give us a sense of accomplishment. We feel like legit foodies, 5 star meal included.”

“That night I cooked an amazing meal with my boyfriend that we both remember more fondly than any movie night, bar none! Next time, I’m inviting all of my friends over and we’re going to have a sushi night at home with a real Sushi Expert! Disclaimer: Sake will be involved. But I simply can’t wait to share this experience and lots of sashimi with my friends! Using Chefter is literally the best cooking hack of all time. It’s like you have someone telling you all of the answers on a test but it’s not cheating!! Every time I call a chef, I feel like I know a little bit more about my kitchen and what I like to eat.”

Chefter is meant to create experiences like these, bringing back life, love and laughter into every one's kitchens again.
