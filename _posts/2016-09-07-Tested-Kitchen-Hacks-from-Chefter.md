After out team tested out "many a hack", we narrowed it down to our absolute favorites and the best hacks we know of! So next time you're in the kitchen, give one of these a try. Do you know of an amazing hack not on our list? Comment and we'll put it to the test!

**Get your knives sharpened once a year.** 

This may seem overrated but it really makes a difference and extends the life of your knives. A knife should be a once in a lifetime purchase. It doesn’t have to be a million dollar knife but it _does_ have to be a good one. It’s a worthwhile investment. Not sharpening your knives yearly makes them dull, which can be _extremely dangerous_. The knife may slip and roll off of objects as opposed to do what they’re designed for, slicing. So don’t skimp on your knives. Plus, it makes the perfect gift for your favorite home cook!


**Easy stainless steel pan and pot maintenance.**

Add a little water, baking soda, kosher salt and a slice or two of lemon to your pot or pan. Bring that to a boil for a few minutes over medium-high heat, let it cool off and then give your pots and pans a quick rinse. They’ll look like new!


**Ultimate baking hack.**

What’s the secret to super fluffy goodness when you’re baking anything? A little steam! Pour a quarter cup of water directly on the bottom of your preheated oven to create steam and humidity. You can add it just before you place your bake in the oven or add it in just before you take it out. The extra moisture helps to fluff up whatever you are baking!


**Save that wine!**

You know that one glass of red wine left in the bottle from the night before? Don’t throw it out! Old wine is perfect to cook with. It adds a rich yet delicate layer of flavor to _literally almost anything_ you’re cooking: poultry, pork, red meats, soups, stocks or even cooked veggies. It always tastes better with wine! 


**Cracking eggs ain’t easy.**

Next time, instead of chasing that little bit of shell around with your fork or fingers, try wetting your fingers and it will be a lot easier to get any pesky pieces of shell out of your egg. 


**Ice cubes- not just for water.** 

Boring, right? Well think again! The possibilities are literally endless. Add in some herbs, edible flowers or fruit juice to your next tray of ice cubes for some extra kick for your glass of water or cocktail. Love iced coffee? What about coffee cubes? Next time you brew up a cup mix together equal parts water and coffee, freeze it in some ice trays and add it to your next ice coffee. _No more watery iced coffee ever_. 


**Have a Cast Iron skillet?**

If you do, it’s important to take care of it. If you wash your Cast Iron skillet with soap and water, always remember to pour in about a tablespoon of oil and polish it into the skillet or else it will rust. _No bueno._ Is your skillet just a little dirty? Pour in a tablespoon of salt and scrub with a paper towel. _Et voila!_ That way, you won't have to re-polish it!
