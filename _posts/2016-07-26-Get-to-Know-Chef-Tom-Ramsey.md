**When did you start cooking?**

As early as I could reach the knobs. I got my first cookbook, “Better Homes and Gardens Junior Cookbook” for Christmas when I was eight years old. I was so fascinated by it that I abandoned by GI Joe Mobile Command Center and read through the cookbook cover to cover. Without telling anyone, I went to the kitchen and made a dish from the book. It was for “Cinnamon Twists.” When I brought them into the den, everyone was amazed that I did it myself and I’ve been hooked ever since.

**So when did you start cooking for a living?**

That took a while. After high school I went to college like all my friends were doing. I didn’t even know there was such a thing as Culinary School and becoming a “chef” wasn’t a career choice that I thought was available to me. I studied film and theatre but ended up in investment banking where I spent most of my professional career. But I never stopped cooking. I did it for fun and family. I cooked most of the meals for my family, did a whole lot of food writing and cooked for charity events, but I didn’t start cooking professionally until 2008.

**What have been some of your major culinary influences?**

I learned how to cook from non-chefs. I admired the fancy cooking and plating techniques of culinary “masters” and tried to emulate what I saw in find dining restaurants or on PBS’s _Great Chefs of Europe_. When I first started cooking professionally, I was pretty unsure of myself and spent a lot of time and energy trying to be “clever” or “exciting”. That’s all worn off and what I like to do now is just keep it really simple. Just using a few great ingredients and looking for taste and balance. I’ve pretty much retired my tweezers. Coco Chanel said that if you want to be perfectly dressed, get yourself ready to go out then look in the mirror and take one thing off - that’s how I feel about my cooking. If a component is adding something to the dish in a meaningful way, I just leave it off. If I have to explain the dish, or how you should eat it … just, no. I’m not discounting or knocking what some chefs are doing with beautiful plating and complicated, elaborate flavors … it’s just not where I am right now.

**What’s next for you?**

Since I closed my brick-and-mortar restaurant last year, I’ve been doing a series of popup restaurants around the country. We call it stäge, which is short for _stagiare_, the French term for “apprentice”. I’m getting to cook with some great chefs and I’m learning a lot. Regina Charbonneau, who owns the King’s Tavern and Twin Oaks in Natchez, Mississippi, and I are co-authoring a cookbook .. actually a series of cookbooks called “Southern Staples Series”. The first one, _Grits and Greens_, should be finished any day now and off to the publishers who will decide its fate. I’ve got my fingers crossed. I’ve got a QSR [quick service restaurant] concept called bōl that I’m rolling out as a licensing and franchise deal. It’s like a cross between Subway and Chipotle - healthy stuff served in a bowl. But when those are up and running, they don’t need anything from me but guidance. I’m enjoying the travel and consulting and the personal appearances, but I do miss being in the kitchen every day. Who knows … we’ll see.
