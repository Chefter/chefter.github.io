**Susan Spicer**- a Parisian-trained chef, [James Beard Award Recipient](https://www.jamesbeard.org/chef/susan-spicer), owner of multiple New Orleans restaurants such as [Mondo](http://mondoneworleans.com/) and [Bayona](http://www.bayona.com/), a local New Orleans charity supporter, Slow Food Movement advocate and all around sweet-heart of cuisine! 

Currently, she’s working on her new, still-unnamed restaurant to be opened in a 1930s New Orleans jail house. I sat down with Chef Spicer to have a conversation about what exactly the Slow Food Movement is and what that means to her as a chef and food lover.

“Slow food is local, seasonal, clean _and_ supports sustainable biodiversity. And it’s some of _the most_ fresh and delicious food you can eat. There’s something so beautiful in staying close to home with your food. It always tastes better, looks better and inspires. It’s really been a driving passion for me. 

“I like creating recipes that are easy to cook in our restaurants, easy to cook at home, and made out of these local, sustainable products. It’s finally getting easier to access these products. And being a chef in New Orleans, I’m spoiled by the quality and abundance of amazing, local seafood. In my restaurants, we make sure to use products harvested with respect and it’s been one of the joys lately that we see developing in the world of food - is a growing awareness in society. It’s really allowed me to explore my passion and share that love with others.”

“Everything moves so quickly today that it’s often difficult to get people to pay attention to the Slow Food Movement but I do believe that more people are starting to become aware. And now with ever-advancing cooking equipment and apps like [Chefter](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1083651067?mt=8), the access to the knowledge and tools of cuisine has never been more tangible. I think people are about to be surprised that with tools like these, they can cook _and_ enjoy real, local food in an elevated way.”
