**Let's talk a little history with our beer.**

***

Oktoberfest. It started in Munich, 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding and the welfare of Bavaria. It was basically an upper-crust royal affair until all the citizens of Munich were invited to come party on the palatial front lawn! It marked such a significant and jubilant time for Munich that people decided to celebrate that time every year, with each subsequent celebration becoming more elaborate and renowned. The more popular the event became, the more beer halls joined the party…until they were throwing the party!


Now from the third week of September to the first week of October, people everywhere celebrate what has become the festival of beer lovers. The tradition is over 200 years old and though it holds special meaning for Bavarians and Germans everywhere, I think it’s also earned a special place in everyone’s hearts. It’s the beginning of fall, the kids are in school, football’s back on, and there’s no better time to enjoy a lovely craft beer.
