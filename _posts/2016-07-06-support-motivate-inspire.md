Chefter. It’s a pretty simple idea. Connect users with professional chefs whenever they need it, for whatever assistance they need. But as we explored this concept, it became increasingly apparent that there are literally thousands of ways that users can interact with Chefter. So in order to guide our journeys, we’re developing the Hostess and that is the topic of today’s blog post.

The Hostess is designed to learn from you as you learn from her. As you continue to use Chefter, building your profile, finding the recipes, chefs and types of cuisine you enjoy, the Hostess learns your preferences and tastes. That way, she can better serve you and your needs every time you log on to Chefter. Conversely, the Hostess is your conduit to the Chefter universe and she can help you explore and learn as much as you want to. It is our goal to engage in a dialogue with you and the Hostess is definitely part of that conversation.

So let’s get creative. Let’s remove any stress or anxiety from the kitchen and focus on enjoying these unique experiences. Let’s build your confidence as a culinary conquistador! As we continue to build up our knowledge and yours, as well as your culinary skills and repertoire of recipes, Chefter can help elevate you from yellow belt to black belt! Hiyah! Currently we are developing even more unique ways to explore food and culture. For instance, how would you like to explore a particular region, like South Africa’s or Germany’s history and culture dish by dish based on historic recipes and tradition? Or you could even explore exciting new fusions of food that you would never think to create.

If you think about it, food is one of the earliest things that not only brought humans together but kept us together. It has played a crucial role in constructing our identities as well as being representative of different cultures, histories, traditions and tastes. Food has been explored in a million different ways and now with Chefter, we can explore it in a million more! How will you begin your journey?
