Labor Day 2016 - it was here before we even knew it! And there’s no better time to get together with friends and family for a weekend celebration. But in every body’s busy lives it can be difficult to bring every one together and even more difficult to focus on enjoying time with your loved ones. So, Chefter wants to give you a quick crash course on how to be the most prepared this Labor Day. That way you can enjoy your friends, family and food without the stress of cooking all day! Here are our _top 5 tips and tricks_ to expertly prepare a truly elevated Labor Day meal. 

***

**Coals**

Don’t skimp on the basics. The thing about lump coals is that it’s just clean wood without any additives or "the other 20 ingredients". Lump coals give you better control of your grill heat and unmatched flavor.

***

**Prep, Prep and More Prep!**

Make your life incredibly easy by taking an hour the day before your Labor Day bash to set up and prepare. You can cut and season your vegetables, prepare a delicious barbecue sauce, make sure you have your trusty lump coals and have everything as ready to go as possible without compromising fridge space or food safety.

**Try a Brine or Dry Rub**

Both brines and dry rubs are really easy ways to elevate your proteins (_and they’re practically fail proof!_). Even if it’s simply a chicken breast or pork picnic ribs, it’ll go a long ways to keeping the meat juicy, flavorful and simply fantastic!

**Understanding Your Temperature**

In the science of grilling, it is really important to understand what temperatures to use and when. There are 3 main temperatures that you’ll want to keep in mind for your next barbecue.

-_The first_ is low and slow. This is where the baffles, or air holes of your grill, are 70% or more closed. You would use this setting to cook bigger cuts or bone-in meats like pork shoulder, a whole or half chicken, or some smoky ribs. With the lid closed and the baffles only slightly opened, the temperature will be right above 200 F. 

-_The second_ temperature is right in the 350 F to 400 F range. This is great for chicken breasts, hamburgers, hot dogs, shrimp, etc. The things you like to see with those beautiful grill marks. In order to get to this temperature, you’ll want to open your baffles about halfway or just leave the grill top open. 

-_This last_ temperature is the hottest and it’s for your steaks. Go ahead and open up your baffles all the way. This allows the air to flow through the coals and it makes them red hot! But don’t be afraid - the hotter the better! The temperature should be 450 F plus. This is the restaurant secret to that perfect juicy steak!

**Smoke Additives**

This is where your grill let's you get really creative. Add a handful of your favorite wood chips soaked in water for an added layer of smokey flavor. You could also try adding small amounts of pecan or walnut shells for a unique, nutty flavor. Both wood chips and nut shells work wonderfully with just about anything you can cook on a grill. If you’re really feeling adventurous the next time you’re cooking chicken, duck or salmon, try adding tea leaves or fresh herbs for more delicate flavor profiles. Adding a small handful of any of these smoke additives along the edges of your coals or even in a hot plate in your gas grill will allow you to explore new flavors and elevate any grill out!
