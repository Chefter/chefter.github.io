For the majority of people out there, cooking can be extremely daunting. Everyone is so worried about what ends up on the plate and how good it tastes, that they totally lose the fun of the experience in the process. Chefter was created to bring fun back into the kitchen with a little extra skill. We love getting feedback from home cooks who talk with our Chefs as often as we can. Recently we received an email from a home cook about their experience and it truly speaks to the power of Chefter. 

A letter from _Cooking in Columbus (GA)_: 

“So instead of going to one of the same few, local restaurants or to see another movie, my boyfriend and I decided try the new app my friend had told me about called Chefter. She's an avid foodie and knows I wish I could be, so we decided to call a chef and stay in for this date night. Neither me or my boyfriend are skilled cooks but we certainly love food. Off the bat, I had a little admitted anxiety about calling a stranger and showing them my basically average kitchen and not so miraculous equipment. After scrolling through all of the Chefs and Recipes, I just _had_ to call and see what all this was about.” 

“First off, I didn't have to face to face with a stranger (okay, I'm a bit socially awkward and was in my PJs)! I was prepared to go through a long explanation of who I am, who the chef was, what I like to eat, blah, blah blah. But it was nothing like that! All I had to do was show my chef my kitchen and what I was doing through my camera. So much easier than any cooking class I've ever taken! Second, it was so cool that we both already knew about each other based on our profiles so we got right to talking about food and cooking. I got Chef Nel, who I think is Jamaican, and most certainly very chill." 

“Having a chef right there on my phone, guiding me through the experience took so much pressure off. I was able to have her tell me how to eye ingredients, which I never thought I’d be able to do. And best of all, my boyfriend and I (and I’m pretty sure Chef Nel, too!) were all having good time, enjoying cooking together instead of me cooking the same few meals and eating out weekly. And the meal we made together with the chef was spectacular to boot! I even got a few cooking tips and tricks from our chef that I’ll probably use every time I'm in the kitchen.” 

“I was even able to take a pic of my own food for Instagram!! One of my proudest accomplishments. I could even tag the chef that helped cook it and, of course, Chefter. It definitely give us sense of accomplishment and we felt like legit foodies, 5 star meal included.”

“That night I cooked an amazing meal with my boyfriend that we both remember more fondly than any movie night, bar none! Next time, I’m inviting all of my friends over and we’re going to have a sushi night at home with a real Sushi Expert! Disclaimer: Sake will be involved. But I simply can’t wait to share this experience and lots of sashimi with my friends! Using Chefter is literally the best cooking hack of all time. It’s like you have someone telling you all of the answers on a test but it’s not cheating!! Every time I call a chef, I feel like I know a little bit more about my kitchen and what I like to eat.”

We believe that experiences like this can happen every time you call in to Chefter and our user feedback always reaffirms this. This letter illustrates the power of Chefter with access to a world of culinary knowledge for you, the home cook. Write in about your experiences because we love to share!
