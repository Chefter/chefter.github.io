Toward the end of September, fall produce starts to become very vibrant and tasty! In order to be at the top of your fall produce shopping and preparing game, here is a list of a tips and tricks for some of our favorite fall vegetables and fruits! 

***

**Apples**


Have trouble with your apples turning brown after you cute them. Place them in a water bath next time until you’re ready to serve or eat them. The water keeps the apple from oxidizing and turning brown. 



**Leeks**


Leeks grow in sand and it can be difficult to get all of that grit rinsed off. Cut your leeks in half long ways and then soak them in a water bath for 4-5 minutes. Bend them backwards to open up all of the folds in the leek. Dry and use them however you’d like. No grit!



**Green Onions**


Green onions or scallions are incredibly easy to regrow. Simply cut the root bottom from the green onions, place it in a cup with a little dirt and some drainage holes. Water it daily, just enough to keep the soil moist. You can grow them inside or outside. Either way, never buy green onions again!




**Leafy Greens (Kale, Mustard, Turnip)**


The best way to make your leafy greens last longer is to grab a plastic food container, place enough paper towels to cover the bottom and then place your leafy greens in the container. Top the leafy greens with another layer of paper towels and seal tight. This should drastically increase the shelf life of your greens. 




**Sweet Potatoes**


To find the perfect tasting sweet potato, look for small to medium sized ones. these will be a little sweeter and smoother tasting. Large sweet potatoes tend to be a little more solid and starchy tasting. Also, you’ll want to find one with no dark spots and even colored skin and the darker the color the better!



**Persimmons**


Persimmons are delicious when in-season but it’s often difficult to find that perfectly ripe one. Here’s a little trick to ripen your persimmons overnight! Simple place them in a ziplock bag in the freezer over night. The next day, take them out of the freezer and let them defrost a good few hours before cooking or eating. You’ll taste and see that they are perfectly soft, sweet and ripe.
