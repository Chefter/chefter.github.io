Everyone loves a rotisserie chicken from your local grocery store. There perfect for soups, casseroles, salads, sandwiches and the list goes on! But how many times have you bought a prepared rotisserie chicken and it tastes chewy or leathery from being under that heat lamp for too long? Cooking a rotisserie chicken is easy, delicious and can be very healthy. Before you go to the store and buy another rotisserie chicken, we suggest trying this fool proof recipe. We bet you’ll never have it store bought again! This recipe really gives you the ability to make it your own. Adjust the seasonings to your preferences or dietary restrictions and use the meat in a myriad of your favorite dishes!

This recipe is provided my Mississippi chef extraordinaire, Chef Tom Ramsey! Get to know him a little better [here](http://bit.ly/2afcJLR). He prides himself on simple yet bold dishes and flavors. That is not better illustrated than in this delicious recipe! We suggest pairing your roast chicken with Chef Ramsey’s roast sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts because what’s better than fresh, local and in-season produce?!

### **Whole Roasted Chicken (Easy Edition)**


**Ingredients:**


- 1 Whole Chicken

- 2 tsp. Dried Thyme Leaves

- 2 tsp. Kosher Salt

- 2 tsp. Black Pepper

- 2 tsp. Garlic Powder

- 2 tbsp. Unsalted Butter

- 1 Lemon

***

**Steps:**


- **1.** Pre-heat oven to 365 F. 

- **2.** Remove giblets and any materials from the cavity of the chicken then pat dry inside and out with paper towel.

- **3.** Mix thyme, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

- **4.** Combine 1 tsp. of the salt mixture with the butter and mix with a fork.

- **5.** Divide the butter in half and slide equal portions between the skin and meat of each breast, taking care not to tear the skin.

- **6.** Rub remaining seasonings on the inside and outside of the bird.

- **7.** Truss chicken with chicken twine by tying the legs together and wrapping twine around each wing to tuck everything in tight to the body of the bird. If you don’t have kitchen twine, don’t panic. Just get some for next time and wrap the ends of the legs and wings in a bit of foil. 

- **8.** Place the chicken in a roasting pan, either on a rack or just in the bottom of the pan, then place in the hot oven and roast for 1.5 hours or until juices run clear from the deepest part of the thigh when pierced with a fork.

- **9.** ALLOW THE BIRD TO REST for 5 minutes per pound. You can lightly cover the bird with foil while resting to keep it warmer.

- **10.** Carve the bird by removing leg quarters at the joint and carving the breast away from the bone and removing the wings at the joint. Top cut chicken with fresh lemon juice and serve.
