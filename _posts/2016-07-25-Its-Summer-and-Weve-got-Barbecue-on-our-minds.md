Barbecue— the art of slow cooking meat over a low, indirect flame. Oh, what a long journey it has been for you barbecue. And in these hot summer months, what’s better than a get together with friends, family and a big pile of barbecue? But before we get to the plate, let’s talk a little bet about the journey. 

Cooking meat over flame is one of the earliest ways that humans began cooking their food. Mastery of flame was a triumph and mastery of food has remained an obsession. Some of the earliest human artifact caches are of animal bone piles with scorch and cut marks on them near fire burnt earth. Once animals and plants became domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago, cooking gained more of a home life. Through years of trial and error, humans developed an understanding and learned from their food. That some meats tasted better when not directly in the flame but instead over burnt, smoky coals over a long period. Techniques were developed and from there different styles thrived. 

The barbecue story goes the Christopher Columbus and his crew encountered indigenous peoples along his journey of the Caribbean and present-day Southern U.S. where he found them cooking meat such as boar, pig and horse over low, indirect heat over long periods of time using grates built out of green wood so they wouldn’t burn. Upon tasting these local delicacies, the Spaniards were so taken with the delicious flavors and tender juiciness of the meat that they brought the “barbacoa” custom back with them. 

Since then, barbecue has taken root literally everywhere over the world and each place has it’s own unique styles and flavors. There are millions of ways for barbecue to be unique— how long you cook it, what kind of wood fired coals you cook it over, where the meat is placed in relation to the flame, what type and cut of meat it is, the seasonings rubbed onto the meat and how you make your sauce.  And for every different way to make barbecue, there is a different region recognized for its special home recipe. From Korean or Mongolian barbecue to Southern Memphis style B.B.Q., we love it all!

**Ingredients:**
***
2 racks Saint Louis Pork Ribs or Baby Back Rips
***
4-5 tbsp. of your favorite dry rub or our Chefter Creole Spice Blend
***
4 cups ketchup 
***
2 cups water
***
1 cup apple cider vinegar
***
7 tbsp. brown sugar
***
7 tbsp. white sugar
***
1 tbsp. ground black pepper
***
1 tbsp. onion powder
***
1 tbsp. mustard powder
***
2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
***
2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
***

**Steps:** 

**1.** Take your favorite barbecue dry rub or try our Chefter Creole Spice Blend and rub both sides of each rack with 2 tbsp. of seasoning per rack. Let this sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
***
**2.** While the pork is refrigerating, let’s make the barbecue sauce. This is our Classic Red Barbecue Sauce. All you have to do is combine the ketchup, water, vinegar, both sugars, pepper, onion and mustard powders, lemon juice and Worcestershire in a medium sauce pan. Bring the mixture to a light boil, reduce the heat and let simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Let the sauce cool to room temp. 
***
**3.** Once the racks have gotten to know the dry rub, wrap them in three layers of tin foil to get a nice seal. If you have a smoker, smoke ribs at 220 F with hickory wood chips for 45 minutes. This will add a lovely extra layer of flavor before you finish your ribs in the oven. If you don’t have a smoker, don’t worry about this step. We promise these ribs will still be incredible!
***
**4.** Take ribs, still wrapped in three layers of foil and cook in the oven at 250 F for 3 hours. 
***
**5.**To finish, remove the ribs from the foil and lightly brown the outside of your pork either by throwing it on the grill for a few minutes or putting them back in the oven under a low broil . 
***
**6.** Serve with your barbecue sauce to some very good friends!
