Thanksgiving- it's one of the best times of the year when friends and families come together over a table full of food to share in good times. The rich flavors of fall are in full swing and cooking goes into overdrive.

But how many time have you been cooking Thanksgiving dinner and -_oh no!_- the turkey burnt, or it's dry, or it won't cook evenly? And then there's the stuffing you forgot to make, the salty mashed potatoes and your dog just got into the green bean casserole! Okay, maybe things don't get this bad but there's always that moment of panic in the kitchen when you're not sure if all your food is going to come out **when you want it, how you want it**. 

Well now there's an app for that! [Download Chefter](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1083651067?mt=8) for free on the Apple App Store and create a profile where you tell us about your dietary restrictions and preferences. Then, for a few cents a minute, you can connect with a trained and professional chef using your forward facing camera. Show them exactly what you're cooking and they can give you an instant answer. 

So if you need to know how to fix your turkey in a jiffy, how to make that picture perfect pie, or figure out the quickest side dish you can bring to your Aunt Sally's, **now you can have the confidence of a cooking _with_ a chef** right on your phone.
