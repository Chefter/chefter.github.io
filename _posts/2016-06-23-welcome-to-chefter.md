This blog will be documenting a revolutionary start up company’s journey of exploring food, culture and society through technology. The brainchild of a chef, an anthropology student and a tech wizard, Chefter’s mission is to change the way we’re thinking about food.

In this increasingly virtual age, how are we brave food pioneers supposed to know where to begin our respective culinary journeys without guidance or experience? The personalized experiences we are creating through Chefter is unlike anything that’s been available before. Reconnect with your past by recreating a traditional dish of your heritage or explore new and exciting cuisine from all over the globe. Make a meal out of the random items in your kitchen or design a five course menu and bring a virtual chef along for your grocery shopping trip!

We are connecting chefs from around the world directly to you in order to create a new, engaging dialogue on food, tech, culture and history. Today, these concepts are increasingly gaining importance as we all strive to move towards heightened cultural awareness and understanding.

No more “authentic” Spanish recipes that are really tex-mex. No more pouring through pages of recipes to find what you want. No more not knowing the right technique or not having the right equipment. No more misinformation. Nothing is off-limits anymore.

This blog will act as the cultural study accompanying the Chefter journey. We aim to post behind the scenes looks of our company and team, exploratory posts of food and culture, exciting developments of food tech, and even share the stories of users like you! Rich culture, delicious food, amazing tech and stories from around the world is what you can look forward to so grab your favorite frying pan and let’s go explore!
