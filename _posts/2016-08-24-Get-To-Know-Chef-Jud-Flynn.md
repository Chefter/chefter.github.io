**MD:** At what moment did you know you wanted to be a chef? 

**JF:** I didn’t know it at first, but I started working for my families restaurant in upstate New York, in Long Lake. I was 13 years old at the time and during the summer break I worked as a dishwasher/chef’s assistant. This was my first real job in life and I thought it was awesome, I could drink as many sodas as I wanted and eat anything on the menu. The work was hard but it was more enjoyable. Each summer I progressed in the brigade of the kitchen by taking on more responsibilities from the chef to becoming his right hand man (well boy). I continued through high school at local restaurants in my home town of Blacksburg, Va.. During this time, I was working behind the kitchen line, sautéing and grilling. I soon became well versed in all the positions in the kitchen and this is when I really started to excel in my craft. I rose to the ranks of Executive Chef by the age of 21. So I feel that I was always destined to be a chef, it’s in my blood.

 **MD:** Can you speak a little bit to your extensive training and certification?

**JF:** I graduated from the Prestigious New England Culinary Institute in 1993 and while at school I competing in to Culinary Competitions winning Gold in each one. I became ACF Certified as an Executive Chef CEC at the age of 28. I competed in every ACF National Competition that I could. For the next 3 yrs. I competed more than 52 times winning an addition 21 Gold Medals and a Olympic Silver Medal in Erfurt Germany (World Culinary Olympics 2000).

**MD:** How do you get inspiration in the kitchen? 

**JF:** Hard work, an eye for detail and the love of great food.

**MD:** What’s your favorite ingredient to work with and why? 

**JF:** Seafood and vegetables, because their are so many different varieties, shapes, colors, flavors and textures.

**MD:** You mainly work with chefs and culinary teams in professional kitchens and environments. With all that master knowledge and training, what is the best advice you can give a home cook? 

**JF:** Take your time when planning your menu/dish that you plan on preparing. I mean make sure that you don’t take short cuts and leave enough time for yourself to figure out the steps that you will need to do to prepare the best dish that you can. Next, taste it, look at it and reflect on your work, do you like it? Would you do anything differently? Make those changes for the next time.
