What separates us from chefs? Ok, they have lots of experience. But there’s also more to it than that. A lot of being a chef is mastering the craft, putting in the hours, and understanding the styles and techniques of different types of cuisine. But for us foodies out there, how are we to gain that experience or translate that knowledge into our own kitchens without committing to the 10,000 hours it takes to get there?

Google how to cook like a chef and you’ll get endless hits of cooking tips like: prep your kitchen, have a game plan walking in, prepare as much as you can ahead of time, know your recipe, etc. But it’s like taking a foreign language class and you learn the vocabulary and practice the grammar but when you go to have a conversation in that language, you’re totally lost. You have the tools but no know-how. It’s time we had a discussion on speaking the language of food. 

Chefs don’t have every recipe ever memorized. Instead, chefs know the elemental building blocks of different kinds of cuisine, what flavors work together best, and different ways to elevate basic ideas about food. Have you ever heard of the Mother Sauces? It’s that there are five foundational sauces that once you know, you can create any other sauce by building off of them. Ergo, once you understand the elemental building blocks of different types of cuisine, you better understand that theory of flavor, what elements can go together and how they do so. 

As one chef has explained it to me, being a chef is like understanding in different languages. If I am from France and speak the French dialect of food, I would look at a tomato completely differently than somebody of a Spanish dialect. A huge part of being a chef is learning to put on these different ‘dialects’ and that’s where all of that practice and experience comes in, and all the fun too. In having that knowledge, one is able to create. You could say the same about brewmasters, cheesemakers or sommeliers. It’s really more about a love of all things food and drink and being able to creatively express that love!

You get to benefit from chefs right on your shoulder. It’s right there so you don’t have to master, you are guided by the master. You have the access to that knowledge. There are no longer any obstacles between you and amazing, unique food and drink. And you’re only required to put in as much effort as you want to because the knowledge of food is already built in for you. So create something unique out of a few basic ingredients in a time crunch with our help or come at us with an idea or something that challenges you and we’ll accomplish it together!
